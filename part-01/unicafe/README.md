# Unicafe Feedback Application

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. The task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad. The application needs to work only during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.

## Step 1: Create the course-info app with Vite+React and using states.

**Goal**: Create an application in React that consists of three buttons for collecting customer feedback and showing the statistics of feedback given.
